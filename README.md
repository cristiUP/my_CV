# Resume website
This is a simple Resume website made in HTML and styled with CSS. Also, I used fontawsome for the icons.

I started it as a resume template, but then I filled it up with my details so now it's my own CV.

Simple design, with the only image being the profile photo, and the rest is just an .html and a .css file, so it should load extremly fast on any device, on any bandwidth.

It is made to be responsive, so you can check it out on desktop/laptop and tablets/smartphones(it will adapt to the screen size).
